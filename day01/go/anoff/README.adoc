== Part 1

The link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48124565/why-does-vscode-delete-golang-source-on-save[biggest struggle] was to configure VScode to allow me adding the `"math"` package to my solution.

I also did not read the manual correctly and forgot to subtract minus 2 at first.

== Part 2

I solved the _fuel needs more fuel_ dilemma by creating a `requiredFuelRecursive` function that takes its intermediate result and calls itself again.
To prevent an endless loop it checks the intermediate result to be positive before recursion.

== Solution

[source, go]
....
include::solution.go[]
....

=== Test cases

[source, go]
....
include::solution_test.go[]
....
