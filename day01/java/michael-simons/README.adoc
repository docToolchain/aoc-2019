== The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation

I have written the solution with my 9 year old kid in Java's https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/jshell/introduction-jshell.htm#JSHEL-GUID-630F27C8-1195-4989-9F6B-2C51D46F52C8[JShell].
The JShell makes it easy to focus on the main part (equation of fuel, mapping inputs), without going through the hassles of building classes and whatnot.

To run the final program, you need JDK 11.
Thanks to http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/330[JEP 330], launching is as easy as `java Solution.java`.

Please bare in mind, that one would possible optimize the computation a bit more, but I wanted my kid to understand it.

The equation was straight forward, that's basic math:

.rocket equations
[source,java,numbered]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=equation]
----

Sadly, I cannot use the `var` keyword to define variables from Lambdas.

We stored the input masses as `input.txt` and used `java.nio.file.Files` to read them line by line. 
This gives a stream of strings. 
I explained that those needed to be turned into numbers and we also spoke about basis of numbers.
For each item of the stream, our equation can be applied.

.Star One
[source,java,numbered]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=starOne]
----
<1> Read the file line by line
<2> Parse the lines into Integers
<3> Apply the equation
<4> Reduce the values to one single value

I was positivly suprised that a reduction was explainable in minutes with a piece of paper.

Star two was a bit more evolved.
I wanted to avoid recursive lambdas. 
Those are possible (and rather easy in JShell, as JShell allows forward references), but hard to understand.

We first settled with the same stream and "flat mapping" each computed fuel value into a new stream, much like in the puzzle itself.
"Flat mapping" is the process of taking one element of a stream and create a new stream from it, thus fanning out the elements of the original stream.
While porting our solution from JShell into an executable Java, I accidently used the wrong variable as initial value for our inner stream (`builder.add(fuelForMass);` instead of `builder.add(fuelForIndividualMass);`).
I noticed that when playing around ideas to make it more readable.

Let's see if can make things a bit more readable:

.Star Two
[source,java,numbered]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=equation]

include::Solution.java[tags=starTwo]
----
<1> We define a second operator, `computeFuelForFuel`
<2> That generates a stream of integers in the form of a glorified for-loop.
    The first argument is the initial value (computing the fuel for the inital fuel), 
    the second argument checks if we need to compute more fuel,
    the third is the operator for the next value, that receives the previous one
<3> We reduce it again, this time not with `0` as the initial value for the fuel, but with the original value we need for the module
<4> Here we concatenate two operators for the mapping. The rest is the same is in the solution for star one.

I was so emberrased for having commited the wrong solution, that I added some simple assertions to the file with values from the puzzle itself:

[source,java,numbered]
----
include::Solution.java[tags=someTests]
----

Be aware that those preconditions are only asserted when you run Java with the `-ea` flag.
They are not a replacement for real tests, but for this solution, they are good enough.

I'm quite positve suprised that a modern Java solution is a readable 13 lines.
