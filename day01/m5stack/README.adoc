I overestimated my free time. 

Between coming back from singing in church and preparing the lunch I had no time to make a clean code, and I was eager to reach part 2. 

Therefore here, not really quick, but dirty the code for the first part (at the end it was good enough for reaching part 2 :-)):

It took me a little while until I found out what I made wrong with the second a part, but finally I made it!!!
