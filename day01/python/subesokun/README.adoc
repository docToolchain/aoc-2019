No need to install and configure Python on your host, just use VSCode and the remote development extension pack for running the code without polluting your host. It's magic ‚ú®

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack

Run the code by hitting the "play" button in the VSCode debugger.
