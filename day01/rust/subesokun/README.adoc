== Fuel calculation

Simple fuel calculation by creating the sum over all masses with the mapping function `floor(mass/3) - 2`. For the second star, I needed to add a recursive function.

[source, rust]

include::src/main.rs[]

== Run instructions üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

No need to install and configure Rust on your host, just use VSCode and the remote development extension pack for running the code without polluting your host. It's magic ‚ú®

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack
```

Open folder in VSCode and re-open folder inside of the dev container by running the quick action

```
Select Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container...
```

Run the program by executing following command in the integrated VSCode terminal

```
cargo run
```
