== Care Package

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

Part 1 is a pretty straight forward solution, run the program, count the number
of elements that are block items.

Part 2 took some more time because I couldn't figure out an elegant solution to
making the game interactive, so instead I went into the input and gave myself an
entire row of paddles instead of the one, and let the game play out like that!
