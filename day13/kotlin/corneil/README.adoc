== Care Package

=== Part 1

The first part was simple leveraging previous components.

=== Part 2

I used the JANSI library from http://fusesource.github.io/jansi/

to control screen output and added an output handler that only prints the modified cells.

I added a fetchHandler to provide the input keeping the paddle under the ball.
Then I realized the program doesn't stop running when all the blocks are cleared so I adapted the IntCode computer to exit waiting for
input and then the next input is determined after checking if there are any blocks left.

=== Running

cd corneil
./gradlew :solution-day13:build
tar xvf ../day13/kotlin/corneil/build/distributions/solution-day13.tar
cp ../day13/kotlin/corneil/input.txt .
