a| * to learn ruby through https://rubykoans.com is fun!

a|{anoff}
a|  * having solved a problem in one language (Go) makes it easy to solve it in another (Ruby)
    * Ruby divisions are `floor` by default
    * Ruby has `.map` and `.reduce` operations 💖
    * file and string handling in Ruby is fun e.g. `File.read("./input.txt").split("\n").map(&:to_i)`

a|{RJPlog}
a|  * The problem was not the coding but not having read the specification thoroughly.
    * Having the wrong test cases does not help you finding the problem
